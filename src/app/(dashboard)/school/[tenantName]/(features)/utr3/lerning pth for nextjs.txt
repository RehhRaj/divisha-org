Let’s Define a Learning Plan (custom to your use-case)

I’ll guide you through each part with code, explanations, and best practices. Here's a suggested roadmap tailored to your goal:

🧠 Phase 1: Core Concepts – Next.js App Router Architecture

Topics:

🔹 Difference between server and client components

🔹 When and why to use 'use client'

🔹 What happens during SSR and hydration

🔹 dynamic() import — what it actually does

🔹 Server Actions vs API Routes

🧰 Phase 2: File Handling on Client (Browser)

Topics:

📥 Uploading files via <input type="file">

📊 Parsing Excel files with xlsx library

💡 Understanding FileReader, Blob, etc.

🧠 Memory and performance tips (how to avoid crashing browser)

📦 Phase 3: Sending Data to the Server

Topics:

🛠️ Using Server Actions to do heavy work

🔁 Sending data from client to server

💾 Optional: Store report on disk or cloud (e.g., S3, Drive)

📥 Returning download link to user

🧮 Phase 4: Server-Side Report Generation

Topics:

📄 Create Excel/PDF reports using exceljs, pdfkit, or puppeteer

🧠 Using async/await in server actions properly

⚙️ Background jobs vs synchronous tasks

💻 CPU/Memory impact — when to use Edge vs Node.js runtime

🧱 Phase 5: Project Structure + Best Practices

Topics:

🧬 File structure: where to keep client/server code

🧩 Reusable components: client-only + SSR-safe

🔐 Security: prevent user from sending malformed data

🧪 Testing & debugging client/server interaction

🧭 Optional: Make it Interactive

If you want, we can also build:

✅ A small timetable editor

✅ Excel file upload + preview

✅ Report generation button (calls server)

✅ Download button to get report

🧑‍🏫 How You Can Learn From Me

You can choose how we go forward:

Option 1 — Guided Lessons

I walk you through each topic one-by-one. You can ask questions any time.

Option 2 — Project-Based

We build a small app together (Excel → Timetable UI → Report).

Option 3 — You Ask, I Answer

You tell me what you’re stuck on or want to learn next, and I teach you just that part.

✅ What’s Next?

If you're ready, tell me:

Which phase or part you'd like to start with?

Do you already have a Next.js project running? (If not, I can help set it up)

Do you want to build a working mini-project as we go?

That way, I’ll tailor everything to your needs and level.
